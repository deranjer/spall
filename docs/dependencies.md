# T00 dependency record

`Cargo.lock` is committed and was generated with Rust 1.96.1 on Windows
(`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`). The project itself has no declared license yet.
The versions and license strings below were verified from the locked registry
manifests on 2026-09-06. Cargo may select compatible patch releases only by
updating `Cargo.lock`; this record names the releases actually locked now.

| Direct dependency | Locked version | Enabled feature/configuration | Registry license string | Exercised by T00 |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| clap | 4.6.6 | `derive`; default features | `MIT OR Apache-2.0` | sandbox and xtask CLI parsing |
| ctrlc | 3.5.2 | default features | `MIT/Apache-2.0` | xtask cancellation cleanup |
| pollster | 0.4.0 | default features | `Apache-2.0/MIT` | synchronous adapter/device startup |
| serde | 1.0.229 | `derive`; default features | `MIT OR Apache-2.0` | JSONL process records |
| serde_json | 1.0.151 | default features | `MIT OR Apache-2.0` | JSONL and smoke summaries |
| thiserror | 2.0.20 | default features | `MIT OR Apache-2.0` | typed host/harness errors |
| tracing | 0.1.44 | default features | `MIT` | sandbox process diagnostics |
| tracing-subscriber | 0.3.23 | `env-filter`; default features | `MIT` | `RUST_LOG` subscriber |
| wgpu | 24.0.5 | default features | `MIT OR Apache-2.0` | clear-only native surface render |
| winit | 0.30.13 | default features | `Apache-2.0` | native window, resize, close event loop |

Only the client package imports wgpu/winit. `sandbox-client` requires the
`sandbox/client` feature, so building `sandbox-server` leaves the server
package's active graph GPU/window-free. The server currently records the
requested listen address but deliberately does not bind it: QUIC transport,
authentication, and multiplayer start in T09.

## Verified Windows prerequisites

- Rust toolchain: `rustc 1.96.1 (31fca3adb 2026-06-26)`, Cargo 1.96.1,
  `stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
- MSVC C++ tools: Visual Studio 2022 Community with `VC.Tools.x86.x64`.
- Reference development host discovered for future gate records: AMD Ryzen 7
  9700X (8 cores / 16 threads), 63.6 GiB physical RAM, NVIDIA RTX 4080 SUPER
  driver 32.0.16.1088.

T00's GPU capability smoke records the adapter/backend from wgpu in its
client JSONL log. It does not claim a renderer-quality or GPU-performance
gate; those begin in T05 and T12 respectively.
