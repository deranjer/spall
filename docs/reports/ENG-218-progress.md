# ENG-218 progress: ordered animal consumers

Date: 2026-10-17. ENG-218 remains in progress. This is measured partial
implementation evidence, not acceptance of animal replication or recovery.

## Integrated replay guard

Main commit `81b89f4` adds a bounded transaction payload fingerprint and
strengthens the existing client replay guard. The same transaction resent with
a new recipient control sequence remains a duplicate. A different logical
payload under the same transaction ID is rejected, including while the original
waits for a terrain catalogue, repair or bulk geometry. A held bulk transfer
cannot be rebound to another transaction. Conflicting repeats cannot advance
the replica clock or replace queue entries.

This reuses `ReplicaWorld.applied_tx` as an ID-to-fingerprint map; it creates no
actor ledger, journal or sequence. The fingerprint includes ordered operation
bytes and every logical transaction field while excluding the transport control
sequence. It checks record counts and serialized size before allocating the
fingerprint payload. Existing wire layouts and schema versions are unchanged.

Changed files:

- `crates/spall_protocol/src/records.rs`: `replay_identity_hash`.
- `crates/spall_protocol/tests/transaction_replay_identity.rs`: bounded identity,
  transport-sequence independence and operation-order tests.
- `crates/spall_client/src/replica.rs`: the existing guard, held transaction
  correlation and committed/catalogue/repair/bulk rejection regressions.

Checks on the main checkout:

- `cargo test -p spall_protocol --test transaction_replay_identity`: 2 passed.
- `cargo test -p spall_client --lib replica::tests`: 27 passed.
- `cargo test -p spall_protocol -p spall_client`: **261 passed, 0 failed,
  2 existing ignored** with local loopback access. An initial sandboxed run
  timed out during the QUIC baseline test's handshake; that isolated test and
  then the complete suite passed with loopback access. Logs:
  `.local/eng218-baseline-liveness-retry.log` and
  `.local/eng218-replay-integrated-tests-loopback.log`.
- `cargo clippy -p spall_protocol -p spall_client --lib --tests -- -D warnings`:
  passed; `.local/eng218-replay-clippy.log`.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `git diff --check`: passed.

Only filesystem incremental-cache hard-link warnings remained. These CPU and
loopback tests are not the combined 1024 m, GPU or population performance gate.

## Integrated lifecycle evidence and exact restore

Commits `a00102d`, `360cdd9` and `41112ff` add and independently verify the
lifecycle commit envelope. Its outer receipt binds the unchanged ENG-217 change,
authoritative death witness and source-fenced pre-motion overlay. Valid death
can catch up after missed motion datagrams, including a clip restart under a
newer epoch; stale source generations, static poses and forged evidence reject.
Topology and motion hashes are separate. This is still a portable reducer,
not an installed wire operation or a completed consumer slice.

Commits `88c1e41`, `1a83051` and `df9a74f` add exact corpse reconstruction and
an owned prepare/commit batch. All component shapes, source shards and mass
properties prepare before any solver insertion. Commit checks the creating
world identity, physics step, body-slot count and every source/owner reservation
before publishing the batch. Invalid later members, cross-member collisions,
stale preparations and preparations from a different world reject atomically.
Density is captured once per material across the batch.

Reconstruction retains original source coordinates and VolumeIds, independent
component poses/twists, a single surviving derived component, retired serial
high-water and empty lifetime source bindings. It does not rerun death or
fracture. The batch is currently limited to cold corpse restore; mixed alive
birth, checked death transfer and restore preparation is the next prerequisite.
Its safety caps (1024 owners, 16 Mi dense cells, 4 million solid cells and
4 million primitives across a batch) bound work; they are not measured
population or 1 km performance targets.

Additional changed files: `spall_protocol/src/creature_owner.rs`, protocol
`creature_commit_review.rs` and `creature_owner_review.rs`; physics
`src/articulated.rs`, `src/world.rs`, `src/lib.rs` and
`tests/corpse_restore_review.rs`; `docs/reports/ENG-218-design.md`.

## Integrated checks after cold-restore batching

Measured on main `963d1b7`:

- `cargo test -p spall_protocol -p spall_physics -p spall_sim -p spall_client`:
  **646 passed, 0 failed, 12 existing ignored**, across 67 test/doc-test suites,
  with local loopback access. Log: `.local/eng218-final-tests.log`.
- `cargo check --workspace --all-targets --all-features`: passed.
  Log: `.local/eng218-final-workspace-check.log`.
- `cargo clippy -p spall_protocol -p spall_physics -p spall_sim -p spall_client --all-targets -- -D warnings`:
  passed. Log: `.local/eng218-final-clippy.log`.
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `git diff --check`: passed.

Release regression checks:

- `cargo build --release -p sandbox --example animal-collision-probe`: passed.
- `target/release/examples/animal-collision-probe.exe --corpse-bounded`:
  passed all 18 existing trout/crow/deer cases. This retains the original
  bounded corpse workload; it does not exercise a populated 1 km world.
  Logs: `.local/eng218-release-build.log` and `.local/eng218-corpse.json`.

Protocol/wire 7, baseline schema 1 and store schema 3 remain unchanged. No
production registration, real lifecycle TopologyOp, actor checkpoint or complete
baseline consumer is claimed by these prerequisite checks. GPU, two-client
animal recovery/crash, population performance and combined weather/1024 m gates
remain unrun.

Next unblocked task: continue ENG-218 through the real typed ordered operation,
bounded correlated bulk transport, complete baseline/segmented staging, and
checkpoint/journal recovery consumers. Production animal spawning remains
disabled. Source edit/fracture synchronization, species/current habitat and
integrated two-client restart/destruction/performance proof still follow.
